any static file that doesn't needs to be routed will go here.
e.g. images, txt, or even static html file.


The web process is that

"Webservers" will look FIRST if the request URL is available in this public folder,
if not, then it will go directly to the routing procedures.
if request URL found here, no need to go to the routing procedures.
